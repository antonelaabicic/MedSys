</p>

## ðŸ“Œ About The Project

The system is built using ASP.NET Web API for backend development and Blazor for a dynamic and interactive frontend interface. Patient data, medical records, checkup details, and prescriptions are securely stored 
in a PostgreSQL database, while uploaded files are managed using MinIO for scalable and reliable object storage.

The application allows doctors to manage patient profiles, schedule and record checkups, upload and review medical files, and maintain a history of prescriptions and diseases. Features include search functionality 
by patient surname or OIB, viewing detailed medical histories, and exporting patient data to CSV for further analysis.

MedSys implements the Repository Factory pattern for data abstraction and employs lazy loading for optimized resource utilization.
